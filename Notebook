# The objective of this challenge is to leverage the Berlin V2X dataset to predict QoS.(Quality of service).

PROPOSED SOLUTION AND UNDERSTANDNING OF THE OBJECTIVE *

Wireless communications, like mobile networks, are continuously evolving. To make these networks better, we can use a technology called machine learning, which helps computers learn from data and make smart decisions. By using machine learning, we can manage network resources more efficiently and make sure that users have a good experience when using their devices.

In this particular challenge, we have a special dataset called the Berlin V2X dataset. It contains information about the performance of mobile networks in Berlin, specifically focusing on two LTE mobile network operators. The dataset includes data from different areas in the city and also includes information about the location of devices using GPS and other context details.

The goal of this challenge is to use this dataset and apply machine learning techniques to predict a measure called "QoS" (quality of service). QoS is a way to measure how well the network is performing for users. In this case, we want to predict the achieved throughput in the downlink, which means the speed and capacity of data that can be received by devices.

By successfully predicting the achieved throughput, we can create useful solutions that can be used in different situations, even beyond the specific network operators or devices used in the dataset. This means that the methods developed in this challenge can be applied to other scenarios, helping to improve wireless network performance and user experience in a broader sense.
